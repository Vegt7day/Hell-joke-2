# WeakRef {#class_WeakRef}

**Inherits:** `RefCounted<class_RefCounted>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} **\<** `Object<class_Object>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

Holds an `Object<class_Object>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. If the object is `RefCounted<class_RefCounted>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, it doesn\'t update the reference count.

## Description

A weakref can hold a `RefCounted<class_RefCounted>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} without contributing to the reference counter. A weakref can be created from an `Object<class_Object>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} using `@GlobalScope.weakref()<class_@GlobalScope_method_weakref>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. If this object is not a reference, weakref still works, however, it does not have any effect on the object. Weakrefs are useful in cases where multiple classes have variables that refer to each other. Without weakrefs, using these classes could lead to memory leaks, since both references keep each other from being released. Making part of the variables a weakref can prevent this cyclic dependency, and allows the references to be released.

`Variant<class_Variant>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} **get_ref**() `const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} `🔗<class_WeakRef_method_get_ref>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

Returns the `Object<class_Object>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} this weakref is referring to. Returns `null` if that object no longer exists.
